## Project Overview

## Objective:
The goal of this project is to make an LED blink on and off at regular intervals using an Arduino board. This serves as a simple demonstration of how to control electronic components through programming.

## Components Required :
**Arduino Board (e.g., Arduino Uno)**
**LED (any color)**
**220-ohm Resistor (to limit current)**
**Breadboard (optional for easier connections)**
**Jumper Wires**

## Understanding the LED :
An LED (Light Emitting Diode) has two terminals:
**Anode:** The longer leg, which connects to the positive voltage.
**Cathode:** The shorter leg, which connects to ground (GND).

## Circuit Setup
Connect the LED:
**Connect the anode of the LED to a digital pin on the Arduino (e.g., pin 13).**
**Connect the cathode of the LED to one end of the resistor.**
**Connect the other end of the resistor to the GND pin on the Arduino.**


## Procedure
**Install Arduino IDE:** Download and install the Arduino IDE from the official website.
**Connect Arduino to Computer:** Use a USB cable to connect your Arduino board to your computer.
**Open IDE and Write Code:** Open the Arduino IDE and paste in the provided code.
**Verify Code:** Click on the "Verify" button in the IDE to check for errors in your code.
**Upload Code:** If there are no errors, click "Upload" to transfer the code to your Arduino board.
**Observe LED Behavior:** Once uploaded successfully, observe that the LED blinks on and off every second.
