Project Overview

Objective
The goal of this project is to make an LED blink on and off at regular intervals using an Arduino board. This serves as a simple demonstration of how to control electronic components through programming.

Components Required :
*Arduino Board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
*LED (any color)
*220-ohm Resistor (to limit current)
*Breadboard (optional for easier connections)
*Jumper Wires

Understanding the LED :
An LED (Light Emitting Diode) has two terminals:
*Anode: The longer leg, which connects to the positive voltage.
*Cathode: The shorter leg, which connects to ground (GND).

Circuit Setup
Connect the LED:
*Connect the anode of the LED to a digital pin on the Arduino (e.g., pin 13).
*Connect the cathode of the LED to one end of the resistor.
*Connect the other end of the resistor to the GND pin on the Arduino.
